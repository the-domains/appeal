**WELCOME TO APPEAL**

We are independent producers who make television series, documentaries and appeal films. We specialise in creating engaging films about humanitarian issues for a mass audience, via broadcast, on-line and global events.

Appeal was founded by Iain 'Thompy' Thompson and Jake Attwell, two experienced, passionate and respected programme makers in the broadcast industry, with decades of experience producing popular TV series for major UK and US networks, working with the very best talent, both on-screen and off.
